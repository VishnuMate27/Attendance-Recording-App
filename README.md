## WhatsApp Clone Application for Android

#### Problem Statement:
Chat rooms have become a popular way to support a forum for n-way conversation or discussion among a set of people with an interest in a common topic. Chat applications range from simple, text-based ones to entire virtual worlds with exotic graphics. In this project, you are required to implement a simple text-based chat client/server application.

#### Proposed Solution:
This project proposes a “WhatsApp Clone Application” to chat and socialize with the user's contacts. This app offers a chat section in which all the user contacts and their chats may appear with the marked unseen messages and last seen of the communication, it also contains a calls section that notes the call logs for the application and the app displays a status section to see the status of contacts. Users can also call, chat or go to upload their status. This project is performed under GDSC BITW and will go for further testing.
